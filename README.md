# Tree-Traversal-Project
This a project I did for my Data Structures (CS256) class. The 'extended linked binary tree' file contains functions that return the in-order, post-order and pre-order traversal of a binary tree, as well as a function that deletes a sub-tree. It also includes various test cases for all of the functions, as well as trees generated to be used in the test cases.
